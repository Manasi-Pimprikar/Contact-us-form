- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap
- [Validator.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator) - Validator.js library for email validation.

### What I learned

While working on this challenge I learned about using third party libraries in the project. I have used Validator.js library in the current project which helped me to validate the email easily and with only few lines of code.
